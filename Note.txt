Standard way to make everything center in flex:
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    text-align: center;
    // Do the following if you want to make text smaller.
    margin: auto;
    max-width: XXXpx;

line-height
(https://dev.to/lampewebdev/css-line-height-jjp)
========================================================
Default value and unitless value
'normal' is the default value if you don't set it to something different. Usually, this means that it is set to 1.2,
this depends on the browser vendor. So what does just a number value without any unit mean?
It is actually a multiplier. It takes the font-size value and multiplies it by 1.2.
Let's calculate the height of one line with the following example.

body {
    font-size: 16px;
    line-height: 1.5;
}
We just have to do the following calculation: 16 * 1.5 = 24px.
So we now know that our text will have a minimum height of 24px.
So it will add 4 pixels under the text and above it. Cool that easy ðŸ˜Ž!

percentage
The % value is a little bit tricky to read. 100% means multiply by 1. Again an example to make it clear.
% value is related to the font-size as well
